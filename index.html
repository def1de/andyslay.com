                            </p>
                            <p>Welcome to our cottage which we hope that you will enjoy as much as we do. Unless we let
                                you know otherwise, please arrive after 12:00 noon on your arrival day and depart before
                                12:00 noon on your departure day.</p>
                            <p>A few guidance points:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>We do not employ a cleaner and so would ask that you give it a clean before you
                                        leave. The Dyson is under the stairs and cleaning equipment in the cupboard
                                        under the sink, which has child locks fitted.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>There is a king-size bed with a king-size quilt and 4 pillows in the front
                                        bedroom and a double bed with a double quilt and 4 pillows in the back bedroom.
                                        You will need to take bedding and towels down with you and may prefer to take
                                        tea towels too, to save having to wash the ones down there before you leave. If
                                        you use the airbed (under bed of front bedroom) as well, there is an extra
                                        pillow with the airbed, but you will need all other bedding for this. Spare
                                        bathmats are in a drawer in the back bedroom.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Rubbish collection is on Wednesdays at about 10:00am. Pop the black bin liner on
                                        the path opposite in the morning. Please leave your non-recyclable rubbish in a
                                        black bin liner in the dustbin when you vacate the cottage at the end of your
                                        stay.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Recycling is also on Wednesdays and alternates with green waste. Please refer to
                                        the Cornwall County Council web site or the (Winnie the Pooh) folder in the
                                        cottage for current list of recyclable items. The dates are on the chart in the
                                        folder (we don&rsquo;t subscribe to the green waste). The recycling lorry comes
                                        early, and it is likely to be worth putting the bags and box out on the path
                                        opposite the night before if you like your sleep! Recycling is kept in the
                                        garden storage box and the bags and separate Glass Bottle/Jar Box next to the
                                        storage box are marked with our address, to make sure that the right ones find
                                        their way back!&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p>Wi-Fi is available (Vodafone Connect 53544460) and the password is
                                        fvy33lhzf4mblpl and also on the back of the Router. The phone signal is poor in
                                        the cottage, so Wi-Fi calling is the way to go!</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>Parking &ndash; There is space for one car outside the cottage. Please note the
                                        small kerb designating the boundary between us and number 3 and do not park
                                        beyond this as next door won&rsquo;t be able to get their car in (see photo in
                                        the file). If you have a second car with you park further up the road (not
                                        opposite gateways) or right down at the bottom of the road where there is
                                        normally plenty of space. To turn your car around, please drive down the road to
                                        the gates to the park and turn there. Please&nbsp;<strong>do not</strong> use
                                        the private drive opposite, as the owner has complained and asked specifically
                                        that we don&rsquo;t.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>Coffee machine &ndash; The milk frother isn&rsquo;t working very well anymore on
                                        the machine. If you like milky coffee, there is a microwave to heat milk and a
                                        hand whisk to froth hot milk if you want. Coffee is kept in the freezer to keep
                                        it fresh.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p>Shed contains Garden Tools, Sun Parasol etc. Padlock Code &ndash; 6158. We have
                                        just installed a picket fence and padlocked gate (same code) between the upper
                                        patio &amp; pond as we welcome children to the cottage. Some dog owners may find
                                        it useful too.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p>There are both a charcoal and a gas BBQ in the back garden. If you use gas,
                                        please turn on the tap at the top of the cylinder and when you have finished,
                                        please remember to turn it off again.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>Basic food supplies &ndash; You will find the cupboards and fridge stocked with
                                        basic supplies and we would simply ask that you restock as appropriate.&nbsp;
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Central Heating - The boiler in the kitchen is usually on hot water only in the
                                        warmer months. If you need the radiators, turn the boiler to hot water and
                                        radiators. If the weather is hot, there is an electric fan in the under stairs
                                        cupboard.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Extractor fan in the bathroom. This is actioned by the light pull, so even if you
                                        don&rsquo;t need the light, please pull it on and off when you shower/bath. The
                                        extractor will continue for approximately 15 minutes after the light is turned
                                        off.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>Departure &ndash; Please don&rsquo;t leave anything in the fridge that is likely
                                        to go off. If you have put the radiators on, please return to hot water only
                                        mode.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p>Dog Owners &ndash; There is an emergency dog box under the stairs with items that
                                        you might have forgotten to bring. If your dog gets on furniture, please use the
                                        throws in the box.</p>

                                    <p>TV &ndash; Press standby on Toshiba remote, then press standby on Manhattan

                                    <p>Dimplex Electric Stove in Lounge. This has a very good &lsquo;smoke&rsquo;

                            <p>Lucky you, you are going to wonderful Cornwall. We hope that you are looking forward to
                                your holiday. There is loads to do in the area, here are a few ideas from us, others are
                                in the wooden box in the lounge and we know you will discover your own special places
                                too. Don&rsquo;t forget to check online for opening times and booking details, as
                                special arrangements will sometimes be in place.</p>

                                <li>
                                    <p>The cottage is set in an &lsquo;Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty&rsquo; the
                                        &lsquo;Tamar Valley&rsquo; and is also part of the &lsquo;Cornwall and West
                                        Devon Mining Landscape&rsquo;, a World Heritage site. From the cottage you can
                                        walk to your left down the road, turn left at the playing field, cross the
                                        field, go down the steps and you are by the River Tamar. There are lots of
                                        lovely walks both on the Cornwall and Devon side of the river and &lsquo;The
                                        Tamar Trails&rsquo; are great for walking, running &amp; cycling. You also
                                        regularly come across evidence of historic Copper and Arsenic Mining.&nbsp;</p>

                                <li>
                                    <p>The Coast: Looe and Polperro are about 45 minutes away on the south coast and
                                        Port Isaac, Padstow, Tintagel &amp; Bude an hour away on the north coast. These
                                        are all pretty and quaint places, but note can be packed in High Season,
                                        particularly school holidays and it will take longer to get there.</p>

                                    <p>Inland: Dartmoor is only 20 minutes or so away with lovely walks and scenery.
                                        Likewise, Bodmin Moor is in the opposite direction and can be explored.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>Shopping: Tavistock, just 5 miles away, has supermarkets (Morrison&rsquo;s,
                                        Tesco&rsquo;s and Lidl) on the outskirts and lots of lovely independent shops
                                        and the Pannier Market (open Tuesday- Saturday) to explore in the town centre.
                                        Callington, also 5 miles away in the opposite direction has a Tesco with fuel,
                                        but is less interesting.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Other Places to Visit: There are also lots of National Trust &amp; English
                                        Heritage properties in the area, Lydford Gorge (NT) is stunning and great for a
                                        walk. Cothele (also NT) is a lovely Tudor House, with gardens and a Quay &amp;
                                        Mill. Calstock is only around 3 miles from the cottage (also a short walk from
                                        Cothele Quay) and a pretty place to visit, have a walk round, take some photos,
                                        enjoy a drink, or in the summer an ice cream. If you fancy a trip to Plymouth,
                                        we recommend the train, free parking at Gunnislake station and around &pound;7
                                        each off-peak return (1/3 off if 3 or more travel together or with a rail card),
                                        plus you get a lovely scenic ride, the ticket even allows you to hop on and off
                                        at the villages along the way should you wish and time permits as the trains are
                                        not frequent! If you like to visit gardens, we thoroughly recommend &lsquo;The
                                        Garden House&rsquo; south of Tavistock; it is beautiful and also has a good tea
                                        room! If you visit, travel to Tavistock first before using SatNav, otherwise you
                                        will be taken down some very narrow roads!!</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Gunnislake: in the village there is a post office, a shop that sells all kinds of
                                        bits and pieces, a pharmacy which is integrated into the doctor&rsquo;s surgery
                                        and a convenience store plus the garage up the hill at Drakewalls has a more
                                        comprehensive convenience store (Co-op). Sadly the Koffi Lodge has recently
                                        closed. However, Williamstown Caf&eacute; has opened in it&rsquo;s place, which
                                        we have yet to try. There are now 2 pubs in the village (sadly it is looking
                                        like &lsquo;The Buccaneer&rsquo; is not going to re-open anytime soon). We
                                        usually use The Rising Sun which serves local beer and has a beer garden with
                                        views of the valley. They are now serving basic pub food most days again, plus
                                        Sunday Lunches. It is worth booking to avoid disappointment and to check what is
                                        on offer, in the summer they sometimes do a BBQ when the weather is good.&nbsp;

                                    <p>Eating Out: If you wish to eat out, here are some suggestions (in addition to the
                                        Rising Sun) that either we or others have said are good, booking is advised of
                                        course.&nbsp;</p>
                                </li>

                            <p>The Rifle Volunteer in St Ann&rsquo;s Chapel is around 2 miles away. It is possible to
                                walk there if you are fit enough to walk up Sand Hill, but it does have a car park for
                                those who want a less energetic excursion! They have a good variety of
                                Vegetarian/Vegan/Gluten Free dishes as well as a range of Meat/Fish meals, so cater for
                                most tastes. In fact, we went with our friend who has an intolerance to onions, and they
                                were very helpful as to which dishes to choose. Booking essential and can be done
                                on-line.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>There is a fish &amp; chip outlet next to the Co-op in Drakewells.</p>
                            <p>We have been told the Sunday Lunch is good at The Queen&apos;s Head in Lower Metherell,
                                but it does get busy, so advanced booking is required.</p>
                            <p>The Ganges Restaurant in Tavistock has had the thumbs up for an Indian. They don&rsquo;t
                                have a license, so take your own alcohol if you would like a beer or glass of wine with
                                your meal.</p>
                            <p>The Cornish Arms and Taylor&rsquo;s, both in Tavistock have been recommended. They are a
                                bit more pricey, so depends on your budget. Take a look at their menus on-line to see if
                                they suit you.</p>
                            <p>If you have been to our cottage before you may have been to The White Hart at
                                Chilsworthy. Sadly, The White Hart is currently closed and on the market for sale. We
                                hope it will find a new owner, who believes in good food and beer as this was a lovely
                                place to enjoy a meal or pint, whilst enjoying the beautiful views.</p>
                            <p>We have recently tried two local caf&eacute;/restaurants for coffee/brunch/lunch, which
                                were good. The Engine House at Compton Park near Callington and The Dartmoor Diner on
                                the A286 south of Yelverton in Devon. So, if you are out and about during the day and
                                don&rsquo;t fancy a pub, these are good for a pitstop!</p>
                            <p>Takeaway services are available in Callington &amp; Tavistock, but delivery services
                                don&rsquo;t usually come as far as Gunnislake.&nbsp;</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Tennis: The playing field has a free tennis court (2 racquets &amp; balls are
                                        under the stairs), a children&rsquo;s play park, plus plenty of room to kick a
                                        ball around.</p>

                                    <p>Cycling: There are two adult bikes in the back garden/shed (padlock key on back
                                        door key ring, you need to provide cycle helmets) which you are welcome to use.
                                        They need to be brought through the house so please be careful of furniture etc
                                        as you manoeuvre them through. There are 5 local Bike Trails based on disused
                                        railway lines (minimal if any public roads) that offer flatish rides in great
                                        scenery. They mostly have cycle hire options if you don&rsquo;t fancy
                                        transporting our bikes. Checkout Drakes Trail (Tavistock to Plymouth), The
                                        Granite Way (Lydford to Okehampton), The Camel Trail (Wenford Bridge to
                                        Padstow), Granite &amp; Gears Princetown Railway route (Dartmoor) and
                                        Andy&rsquo;s favourite, The Mineral Tramways (Portreath to Devoran &ndash; North
                                        to South Coast). All these are of course suitable for walking on too, especially
                                        useful when weather has been wet and footpaths can be muddy.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p><u><strong>There are OS maps in the wooden box to take with you.</strong></u></p>
                            <p><br>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><u><strong>Suggested Local Walks</strong></u></p>
                            <p><strong>Please note that adders can be found on open moorland and countryside, so take
                                    care when walking your dog.&nbsp;</strong></p>
                            <p>1/ The nearest and shortest walk would be out of the front door and turn left to the park
                                which is 100 metres down the road. On the opposite side of the park you will find steps
                                that take you down to the river. Left takes you up to Newbridge (about 1/2 mile) This is
                                the stretch where we have seen most of the Otters, although it is quite rare so no
                                promises! If you turn right at the bottom of the steps you head towards the Weir which
                                is tidal below. You then come out by some cottages at the bottom of our road. Turn left
                                and proceed to the left of the cottage ahead of you. This takes you to a disused lock
                                and pretty lock house on an island. When you get to the next house the footpath
                                continues, but only for 100 metres (seen otters here too) then stops. You can climb the
                                road to the side of the house which takes you back along Calstock Road past the Pub
                                (free biscuits behind the bar for dog owners buying a drink!) then back towards the
                                village and down Kingswood Road to get back to the Cottage.</p>
                            <p>2/ Tamar Trails (Map in the wooden box). This involves crossing the bridge so I would
                                suggest taking the car as the bridge is narrow and fairly busy if you are walking a dog,
                                but fine on your own are there are &quot;V&quot;s for you to go in to if traffic is
                                coming across. As you cross the bridge turn immediately left by the white Toll House and
                                along the track for a couple of hundred Metres. You will find that it then opens out and
                                there is space for about 6 cars. (alternatively you can drive up to Tamar Trails on the
                                main road, but they have a pay &amp; display car park!) Follow the river upstream. You
                                will see several streams coming out from the hillside. These often come out of Addits
                                (Horizontal entrances to the mines) and you can even see the odd pit prop still in
                                place. There are miles of intersecting tracks as you move away from the river amongst
                                the woods and the remains of old, mainly copper mines. Higher up the slopes you might
                                get to Devon Consols Mine. This was one of the richest Copper mines in its day. At the
                                start of the 20th century it was mined for Arsenic and the brown/red slag still has very
                                little growth on it 100 years after mining stopped. There is a large colony of Greater
                                Horseshoe bats in some of the mine shafts. These are rare in the UK and quite impressive
                                with a wingspan of nearly 1 foot. We have seen them occasionally on the way back from
                                the pub! Night Jars also nest up there and you will sometimes hear them around dusk
                                making a sound something like Crickets.</p>
                            <p>3/ The Ridge opposite the Cottage. Due to crossing the bridge I would again suggest
                                taking the car to get started if you are walking dogs, but otherwise walk along the
                                river and carefully up the road. Cross the bridge and up the main road to the right.
                                After a few hundred Metres the road swings left, but you go straight on where you will
                                find a small car park for the South Bedford Mine. Over the stile and start climbing
                                along the path. You want the Chimney Rock path. There is a marker post (17?) where it
                                heads off to the right. This is a lovely walk just below the ridge. The photo in the
                                kitchen is of the Cottage from Chimney Rock. Keep walking as far as you like. The path
                                swings to the left along a crease in the hillside and along a valley where you can hear
                                a stream tumbling down to the river. As you cross the stream bear right (but remember
                                this spot as you may take a different return route - see later). There are a couple of
                                good viewpoints along here behind barrier fencing which is easy to get round. These are
                                crags overlooking the valley (Picnic Rock and Morwell Rock), but don&apos;t go too close
                                to the edge as there is a big drop. Eventually you will get to Morwelham (local tourist
                                attraction) where there is a nice pub and you can push on further following the mine
                                railway (public footpath is along the railway tracks and move off to the rive side if
                                the toursit train comes chugging along) past the entrance to the mine to a deserted
                                keyside called Newquay. If you have walked from the cottage you are at about 5 miles at
                                this point. On the return leg consider continuing straight when you cross the stream
                                (mentioned above). This will broadly follow an old mine train route under the main road
                                and to the top end of the Tamar Trails then follow the tracks down towards the river and
                                generally to your left to cross the bridge. This wouyld work out as about 12 miles in
                                total.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>4/ Kit Hill This is a 4 mile drive, but a favourite with many of the local dog walkers.
                                Drive up the main road towards Callington. After about 3 miles you will see Kit Hill
                                signposted to the right. There are several free car parks as you head up the hill. Kit
                                Hill has stunning 360 degree views of the Tamar Estuary, Devon and Cornwall. From the
                                lower car park I would estimate that it is a 3 mile walk all the way round (less higher
                                up) with plenty if intersecting paths. If you smell Pasties it means that Ginsters down
                                in Callington have just finished a batch. They smell better that they taste so I would
                                recommend tracking down OTT Pasties or Heluva Pasties if you get a chance. If I go out
                                to buy a Pastie I will normally stop here to eat it and enjoy the view.</p>
                            <p>5/ White Hart Pub Chilsworthy (currently sadly closed). This is a 2 1/2 mile walk each
                                way but really lovely walk, with views of Dartmoor from Chilsworthy. Walk over the
                                playing field to the river and turn left towards the bridge. This time cross the road
                                and stay on the Cornwall side and go along the track past the garage. Ignore the first
                                two footpaths heading up to the left and keep going at roughly the same level. after
                                perhaps 1/2 mile the cricket club will be straight ahead and the footpath turns left
                                (easy to miss) The path goes through woodland above the river, then drops down to the
                                river where you will find some old mine workings (Gunnislake Clitters) There are the
                                remains of an old engine house that was powered by a water wheel rather than steam, but
                                otherwise looks the same. when you have explored this, carry along the path that will
                                rise ever more steeply until you get to a single-track road. Turn right and follow the
                                road past various driveways the road turns sharp left and then a little further the
                                footpath is straight ahead of you (I think the road stops here and become a private
                                driveway from memory.) Climb the path until you get to the road in Chilsworthy and turn
                                left, pass the closed pub and then take the path to the right of the house ahead and you
                                will soon walk along a disused railway platform! At the railway bridge turn left along
                                the road bear right at the junction past more mine workings. Descend along the road and
                                as it turns right with a house in front of you turn left beyond the house and after
                                about 50 yards there will be a path to the right. This takes you down past some Alpacas
                                in a field and eventually joining the track by the garage near the bridge.</p>
